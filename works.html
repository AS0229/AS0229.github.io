	<p>Title: Just joke<br>Concept: Pretending to be seriously made of jokes only. But something are real thing. <br>Tool: Paste Gif image and write AA(emoji).<br>Inspiration: My friend often made this emoji well and sent it to me. I enjoyed playing with this net emoji with my friend. So I made net art by using it.
